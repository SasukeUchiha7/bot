    <p>
        Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases.
        A vaccine helps the body’s immune system to recognize and fight pathogens like viruses or bacteria, 
        which then keeps us safe from the diseases they cause. Vaccines protect against more than 25 debilitating or life-threatening diseases,
         including measles, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, meningitis, influenza, tetanus, typhoid and cervical cancer.

        Currently, the majority of children receive their vaccines on time. However, nearly 20 million worldwide still miss out –
        putting them at risk of serious diseases, death, disability and ill health.
